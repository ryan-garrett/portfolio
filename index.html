              As part of the Accenture Apprenticeship program I went to Sunderland University during my time at Accenture to study Digital Technology Solution’s & Software Engineering. 
              This course allowed me to get experience and develop my software skills such as web development, cyber security, networking and software design. For example some of my 
              main assignments had me working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Java & Adobe XD to build digital solutions for the given assignment briefs. My final dissertation was an 
              investigation into how web mobile impacts people with disabilities and how to build a fully accessible responsive website. My initial finds were when responsive websites 
              were done incorrectly, this had a negative experience when people with accessibility needs used it. This lead to me building a responsive online comic/book store where 
              people could trade their comics and books with other users. This was built in Vue.js/SCSS and met the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 requirements. 
              To help show my findings, I user tested it with people with accessibility needs where it received positive feedback. Through hard work I finished university with a 
              first Class (1st).

        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="case-study-1">Upgraded multiple services & fixed their accessibility issues</h2>
        <p class="text">
          I was brought onto a HMRC team that had their complete service accessibility tested and failed to meet accessibility standards. This was a huge concern for the project 
          leads as it was a legal requirement for the services to meet the WCAG 2.1 requirement. The service was made up of around 8 repositories that all used the old frontend 
          libraries. The frontend code its self was written by backend developers with no experience in frontend development. They had used the old frontend library as their 
          only guidance which meant the frontend code wasn’t up to standard and it hadn’t been coded with accessibility in mind.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Before I got started, I made a case to the design lead and project manager that the services needed to be upgraded to the latest Government Digital Service (GDS) 
          Design System components in order to be more accessible. I suggested this as the older frontend components either had bad contrasting colours, used incorrect HTML 
          e.g using the wrong heading tags, tables with no captions or inputs without labels. And even small things such as components using tables when they could have been 
          detailed lists or summary lists. All these issues were part of the reason the service failed its accessibility test. Originally there was push back from the design team 
          since the upgrade meant visual changes. However I convinced them it was for the greater good as the newer components had been designed with accessibility in mind. 
          Unlike the older components which made it harder for screen reader to communicate what was presented on the screen or could have made components harder view for people 
          with sight issues. I convinced them by setting up sessions to teach them how the likes of assisted technology work and how switching to the new frontend library would 
          benefit any disabled users, in turn improving the user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I was set out with the task to upgrade all the repositories and to do a complete rebuild using the new frontend library components. While doing this I would need to 
          assess any accessibility failures that would need addressing before the services went for a retest. One of the challenges I was facing was multiple developers were 
          working in these repositories which meant communication was key with the other developers about what was being worked on. If I failed to do this then it would lead to 
          many conflicts as I was rewriting the frontend pages.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I started off by breaking the repositories into phases to make it easier for code reviews, more feasible to communicate what sections were being working on and to make 
          it manage-able for our tester to test the upgrades. In each phase I upgraded the project to use the new frontend libraries, re-wrote the code to use the new components, 
          cleaned the frontend code and ensured each page met the WCAG 2.1 requirements. During this process I worked closely with the lead designer as there was slight 
          differences in visuals between the old frontend library and the new. Additionally there were cases where the old components were bad for user experience so I raised 
          these issues with the lead designer and worked along side them to improve them, using the newer GDS Design System components. Once each phase was complete, I set up 
          meetings with the lead designer, product manager and tester to demo the new upgraded screens with the purpose of gathering feedback. Once the screens were signed off, 
          the phases were sent to the tester where I made sure I was available for any questions they had. During each phase I was always planning in advance about what I was 
          upgrading in the next phase. Making sure I was communicating this information using our dev channels and sprint plannings so we could plan the work with the least 
          amount of conflict.

        <p class="text">
          The team have just started sending the repositories for a retest with the accessibility team. The smaller repositories were sent first where they are successfully 
          passing the accessibility tests which means we are hitting the legal requirement due to the work I have done. The service its-self has been deployed where it’s being 
          used by 14,000 registered users. The new-ish look is getting positive feedback across the board.

            geared to backend work therefore my frontend skills tend to be more limited. Working with Ryan has increased my skills within the frontend domain, he has shown 
            me how to perform changes, upgrades and improvements as well as taking the time to explain why certain technical aspects required. Thus widening my knowledge and 
            making me a better developer. Without failure he takes initiative to drive tickets and tests the waters in the scala language. I can without a doubt say he is 
            a fantastic listener and very sharp. Daily we pair together and come across hordes of scala code. Every day I explain new concepts to him and the reasoning to 
            various in-depth scala code, I'm quite jealous he understands it faster than I did when I started off. Absolute pleasure to have on the team. To improve, 
            from where I am standing, is to keep the same high standard daily as its very difficult to stay at the top it’s been reached."

        <h2 class="heading--medium">Helped develop service prototypes</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Since we were moving the services from the old frontend libraries to the newer frontend, I noticed all the UI prototypes were using the old frontend components and 
          not the new ones. I raised this issue as in the upgraded frontend there are slight visual differences with the components compared to the old ones. For example there 
          was a page in the prototype which used an old component, a on/off toggle whereas that component didn’t exist in the new GDS component library. This could have caused 
          issues say when user testing, it wouldn’t have provided accurate feedback for our newer upgraded service. It could also lead to confusion when demo’ing the prototype 
          to the developers on how the design team want pages to be presented. As the developers would be working with components that may not exist or look vastly different.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          After raising this issue, I was instructed to replicate the old prototypes in a new repository with the latest GDS Design System components. This all had to be complete 
          before the next round of user testing as the design team wanted to use the new screens to get more accurate feedback. I also had the additional task of up skilling a 
          HMRC apprentice in frontend e.g HTML, CSS, Javascript (JS) and accessibility.

          <div class="side-by-side-text">
            <p class="text">
              With deadlines in mind, I delegated the work out between me and the apprentice. We started off pair programming so that I could teach them how to write correct 
              HTML, CSS & JS that met coding standards. Once they picked up suitable knowledge, we split off to work on our own screens so that we were working efficiently to 
              meet the deadline. On some of the screens that were assigned to me, there were a couple of complicated components to recreate such as search bars with filters or 
              tables with pagination. To build these I had to combine a mixture of the new GDS Design System components while keeping it fully accessible. When I wasn’t working 
              on my own screens I set up regular code reviews and demo’s to give constant feedback to the apprentice that helped them learn and grow in the frontend world. This 
              allowed them to pick up more difficult tasks that also helped the work load on me. Since the prototypes could be a source for the backend developers to copy 
              frontend code from, I wanted to make sure the prototype was fully accessibility too. To do this I also set up a meetings with the apprentice/Lead designer and 
              taught them how to use tools like WAVE to test their code in browser.

        <p class="text">
          Through teamwork and hard work we met the user testing deadlines and produced a high standard prototype that was demo'ed at the user testing sessions. This allowed 
          the design team to get more detailed, authentic feedback that would allowed them to design and develop a service to meet the users needs.

        <h2 class="heading--medium">Lead frontend developer on a new HMRC catalog service</h2>
        <p class="text">
          HMRC wanted a new strategy to make finding information about API’s more accessible and easier to use for external and internal use. The current method was complicated 
          and difficult for developers to locate and explore the different API’s for offer. This lead to an ask for a new service to be built that cataloged API’s to allow 
          developers to freely search through them with the help of filters and to provide detailed information on how to use them. The goal was to hopefully improve peoples user 
          journeys and make it easier for them to find API’s. The service was to be designed and built from scratch.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Being the frontend developer lead on this project, I was brought onto the project at the start with the purpose of working along side the lead designer to help develop 
          the prototype. Here I would need to provide component guidance, make changes based on user feedback and to ensure the prototypes were meeting the accessibility 
          requirements. When the prototypes were complete, I was to develop the actual frontend for the service with the help of the backend developers. I would need to code 
          review all the frontend work to guarantee accessibility and code standards were being met.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I co-built the prototype with the lead designer. We split the screens between us, working off story boards that had been built from requirements. To maintain the 
          prototypes accessibility standards so that other developers could copy and use code from, I provided guidance to the lead designer in regular calls and review sessions. 
          I found these sessions helpful for my own development as they would go away to learn more about WCAG/accessibility and then show me their findings through their work. 
          It was important we got the prototype complete in a timely fashion as we needed to get it out in front of users testing sessions. To help achieve this we set out to 
          make re-useable components and CSS where we could. This also meant if there was a design change, we would only had to change it in 1 place. The custom components in 
          the new service were assigned to me so that they could be carefully built to ensure the accessibility needs were still being met. Once the prototype was complete, I 
          took to the task of making sure what we built in the prototype was being transitioned over into the actual service and helping the backend developers where I could.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The result of our efforts was we delivered and released the new service that held over 1000 API’s and it passed its scheduled accessibility review with flying colours! 
          The service is now 1 year into public beta which is constantly evolving through user feedback. This would not have been possible if I didn’t manage to get it to meet 
          the WCAG 2.1 legal requirements. The service has also received good feedback from internal and external teams, noting they found the service easier to find and locate 
          API information.

          My job was to develop the screens that had been designed by the design team and to work along side the backend developers, tasked to hook up the backend and frontend. 
          This was a fast pace project where we had weekly releases which meant we had to develop, test and deploy with tight deadlines while delivering high standard/accessible 
          code. With it being a fast pace project, there were new requirements all the time where I had to priorities new features based on what was most useful for users such as 
          a language switch for Welsh users.

              At the start of development I realised there wasn't any mobile designs and raised it as a high risk problem since it was going to be a public facing website where users 
              were most likely going to be using a mobile phone. Here I took action to communicate with the designers while developing the frontend to make it fully responsive for 
              all devices and browsers. I used the Government Digital Service (GDS) Design System components to develop the search page and the results page. I also volunteered 
              to code review the other frontend sections of the service. When my tasks were complete I would work with the HMRC accessibility team to help spot and fix any issues 
              we saw. I also took this oppertunity to learn more about accessibility, to advance my knowledge by listening to their guidance and methods of testing.

          The launch of Eat Out to Help Out scheme was a success and used by millions of members of British public where it got fantastic feedback. Each day it was used by over 
          100 thousand users and we barely got any noted bugs which goes to show how solid the frontend and backend code was developed.
