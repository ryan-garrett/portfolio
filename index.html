              As part of the Accenture Apprenticeship program I went to Sunderland University during my time at Accenture to study Digital Technology Solution’s & Software Engineering. 
              This course allowed me to get experience and develop my software skills such as web development, cyber security, networking and software design. For example some of my 
              main assignments had me working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Java & Adobe XD to build digital solutions for the given assignment briefs. My final dissertation was an 
              investigation into how web mobile impacts people with disabilities and how to build a fully accessible responsive website. My initial finds were when responsive websites 
              were done incorrectly, this had a negative experience when people with accessibility needs used it. This lead to me building a responsive online comic/book store where 
              people could trade their comics and books with other users. This was built in Vue.js/SCSS and met the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 requirements. 
              To help show my findings, I user tested it with people with accessibility needs where it received positive feedback. Through hard work I finished university with a 
              first Class (1st).

        <h2 class="heading--medium" id="case-study-1">Upgraded multiple services & fixed their accessibility issues</h2>
        <p class="text">
          I was brought onto a HMRC team that had their complete service accessibility tested and failed to meet standards. This was a big service made up of around 8 repositories 
          that all used the old frontend libraries. The frontend code its self was written by backend developers with no experience in frontend development, they had used the 
          old frontend library as guidance. I made a case to the design lead and project manager that the services needed to be upgraded to the latest Government Digital Service 
          (GDS) Design System components in order to be more accessible. Originally there was push back from the design team since the upgrade meant visual changes. However I convinced 
          them it was for the greater good as the newer components had been designed with accessibility in mind unlike the older ones. Teaching them how the likes of screen readers work
          and how switching to the new frontend library would benefit these and overall improve the user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I was given the task to upgrade all the repositories and to do a complete rebuild using the new frontend libraries. While doing this I would need to assess any 
          accessibility failures that needed addressing before the services went for a retest. One of the challenges I was facing was multiple developers were working in these 
          repositories which meant I had to keep constant communications with the other developers about what was being worked on. If I failed to do this then it would lead to 
          many conflicts as I was rewriting the frontend pages.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I started off by breaking the repositories into phases to make it easier for code reviews, more feasible to communicate what sections were being working on and to 
          make it manage-able for our tester to test the upgrades. In each phase I upgraded the project to use the new frontend libraries, re-wrote the code to use the new components, 
          cleaned the frontend code and ensured each page met the WCAG requirements. During this process I worked closely with the lead designer as there was slight differences in 
          visuals between the old frontend library and the new. Additionally there were cases where the old components were bad for user experience so I raised these issues with 
          the lead designer and worked along side them to improve them using the newer GDS Design System components. Once each phase was complete, I set up meetings with the lead 
          designer, product manager and tester to demo the new upgraded screens with the purpose of gathering feedback. Once the screens were signed off, the phases were sent to the 
          tester where I made sure I was available for any questions they had. During each phase I was always planning in advance about what I was upgrading in the next phase. Making 
          sure I was communicating this information using our dev channels and sprint plannings.

          The team have just started sending the repositories for a retest with the accessibility teams. The smaller repositories were sent first where they are successfully 
          passing the accessibility tests and the new-ish look is getting positive feedback across the board.

            "Over the last five months Ryan has been fantastic. He has been the driving force of our frontend. Not only he has proved to collaborate well 
            within a pair programming environment but has also proven to countless times to deliver at pace on his own. Ryan shows drive and commitment daily by continuously 
            striving to add value to the project, he understands the vision and culture of HMRC integrating well with the environment and atmosphere. Personally, I am more 
            geared to backend work therefore my frontend skills tend to be more limited. Working with Ryan has increased my skills within the frontend domain, he has shown 
            me how to perform changes, upgrades and improvements as well as taking the time to explain why certain technical aspects required. Thus widening my knowledge and 
            making me a better developer. Without failure he takes initiative to drive tickets and tests the waters in the scala language. I can without a doubt say he is 
            a fantastic listener and very sharp. Daily we pair together and come across hordes of scala code. Every day I explain new concepts to him and the reasoning to 
            various in-depth scala code, I'm quite jealous he understands it faster than I did when I started off. Absolute pleasure to have on the team. To improve, 
            from where I am standing, is to keep the same high standard daily as its very difficult to stay at the top it’s been reached."

        <h2 class="heading--medium">Helped develop service prototypes</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Since we were moving the services from the old frontend libraries to the newer frontend, I noticed all the UI prototypes were using the old frontend components 
          and not the new ones. I raised this as an issue as in the upgraded frontend there are slight visual differences with the newer components compared to the old. This could 
          have caused issues say when user testing, it wouldn't have provided accurate feedback for our newer upgraded services. It could also lead to confusion when demo'ing to 
          the developers on how the design team want pages to be presented, compared to what would actually be produced on the newer upgraded frontend.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          After raising this issue, I was instructed to replicate the old prototypes in a new repository with the latest Government Digital Service (GDS) Design System components. 
          This all had to be complete before the next round of user testing as the design team wanted to use the new screens to get more accurate feedback. I also had the additional 
          task of up skilling a HMRC apprentice in frontend.

            <p class="text">
              With deadlines in mind, I delegated the work out between me and the apprentice. We started off pair programming so that I could teach them how to write correct 
              HTML, CSS & JS that met coding standards. Once they picked up suitable knowledge, we split off to work on our own screens so that we were working efficiently 
              to meet the deadline. On some of the screens that were assigned to me, there were a couple of complicated components to recreate which I had to combine a 
              mixture of the GDS Design System components while keeping it fully accessible. I set up regular code reviews and demo's to give constant feedback to the apprentice that 
              helped them learn and grow in the frontend world. This allowed them to pick up more difficult tasks that also helped the work load on me. Since the prototypes could be a 
              source for the backend developers to copy frontend code from, I wanted to make sure the prototype was fully accessibile too. To do this I set up a meeting with the 
              apprentice/Lead designer and taught them how to use tools like WAVE to test their code in browser.

          Through teamwork and hard work we met the user testing deadlines and produced a high standard prototype that was demo'ed at the user testing sessions. This allowed 
          the design team to get more detailed, authentic feedback that would allowed them to design and develop a service to meet the users needs.

        <h2 class="heading--medium">Lead frontend developer on a new HMRC catalog service</h2>
        <p class="text">
          There was an ask for a new service to be built that cataloged API's for external and internal use. This was to hopefully improve peoples user journeys and make it easier for 
          them to find API's. The service was to be designed and built from scratch.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Being the frontend developer lead on this project, I was brought onto the project at the start to work along side the lead designer to help develop the prototype for the new 
          service. When the prototypes were complete I was to develop the frontend for this service with the help of the backend developers. I would have to code review all the 
          frontend work to guarantee accessibility and code standards were being met.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          To help maintain a fully accessible prototype that other developers could copy and use code from, I provided guidance to the lead designer in regular calls and 
          review sessions. I found these sessions helpful for my own development as they would go away to learn more about WCAG/accessibility and then show me their findings 
          through their work. It was important we got the prototype complete in a timely fashion as we needed to get it out in front of users testing sessions. To achieve this we set 
          out to make re-useable components and CSS where we could. This also meant if there was a design change, we would only have to change it in 1 place. The new service was 
          made up of custom components that had to be carefully built by me to ensure the accessibility needs were still being met. Once the prototype was complete, I took 
          to the task of making sure what we built in the prototype was being transitioned over into the actual service and helping the backend developers where I could.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The end result was we delivered and released the new service that passed its scheduled accessibility review with flying colours! The service also received good feedback from 
          internal and external teams noting they found the service easier to find and locate API information.

          At the start of the pandemic there was a scheme set up by the government to try and get people to eat out at restaurants in order to boost their revenue during the tough 
          financial time. This was called the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme. I joined one of the main teams as a frontend that was responsible for developing the search and results

          My job was to develop the screens that had been designed by the design team and to work along side the backend developers, tasked to hook up the backend and frontend. 
          This was a fast pace project where we had weekly releases which meant we had to develop, test and deploy with tight deadlines while delivering high standard/accessible 
          code. With it being a fast pace project, there were new requirements all the time where I had to priorities new features based on what was most useful for users such as 
          a language switch for Welsh users.
